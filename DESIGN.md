# Library Design

---

This document aims to lay out the design ideas intended to be implemented in the
future of this library.

## Remarks of Current Implementation

At this stage, I would say the library is an MVP. However, there are some
improvements that could be made to make it more usable. I will, however, tackle
these in a later commit, because it's 3:01 AM and I would like to sleep.

## Possible Future Implementations

See above.
