# JS Test

## About

This is a JavaScript library for testing that is not, nor tries to be, different
in any way other than the fact that it is secure. When you include this module
from NPM, this is the _only_ module you include. Period. And that's the way it
should be. This project is the start of a change to make NPM actually decent,
and not clutter users' `node_modules` folders with half a gigabyte of nonsense
that doesn't actually relate to _their_ project. I do not intend for this to be
the next big thing or _anything_ like that; only that it can be something that I
can personally use that won't be bloated with junk.
